- 👋 Hi, I’m @bustersims
- 👀 I’m interested in video game design and the limitless possibilities within.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to refine and efficiently utilize my growing knowledge of 2d and 3d animation, and how to tastefully blend the two.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on animation projects and I can provide fully confident voice talent while gaining a growing understanding of the animation aspect of this journey.
- 📫 How to reach me best would be at buster.sims@proton.me
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Taco cat spelled backwards is taco cat.
